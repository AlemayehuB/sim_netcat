I made separate functions that handle the UDP and TCP cases. I didn't use threads
so my client just sends text that is inputed into the terminal and my server just
receives and outputs that text onto the terminal.

For some reason the UDP doesn't work when I type use the text localhost but works
when I put in 127.0.0.1. I was kind of confused on how we could test this other than
own localhost.
